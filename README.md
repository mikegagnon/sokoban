# Sokoban+

A JavaScript project walk-through for novice programmers.

In this project you will make a game called Sokoban+. Check it out.

## Prerequisites

Mastery of [Lights Out](https://github.com/mikegagnon/lights-out/blob/master/README.md),
[Thumb Wrestling](https://github.com/mikegagnon/thumb-wrestling/blob/master/README.md), and
recursion (see [linked lists](https://github.com/mikegagnon/linked-lists/blob/master/README.md) and
[binary search trees](https://github.com/mikegagnon/bst/blob/master/README.md)).
And familiarity with OOP (object-orient programming) in JavaScript.

## Contents

## Lecture 1. OOP Approach

I regret to report that in Lights Out and Thumb wrestling, our code was a jumbled mess of global variables, global functions, game logic, and vizualizations.

In this project, we'll develop our code with better practices.
