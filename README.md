# Sokoban+

A JavaScript project walk-through for novice programmers.

In this project you will make a game called Sokoban+. [Check it out](https://mikegagnon.github.io/sokoban/).

## Prerequisites

Mastery of [Lights Out](https://github.com/mikegagnon/lights-out/blob/master/README.md),
[Thumb Wrestling](https://github.com/mikegagnon/thumb-wrestling/blob/master/README.md), and
recursion (see [linked lists](https://github.com/mikegagnon/linked-lists/blob/master/README.md) and
[binary search trees](https://github.com/mikegagnon/bst/blob/master/README.md)).
And familiarity with OOP (object-orient programming) in JavaScript.

## Lecture 1. Modular approach

I regret to report that in Lights Out and Thumb wrestling, our code was a jumbled mess of spaghetti code.

In this project, we'll develop better code by using better design. Specifically, we'll be using modular
design which includes OOP (object-oriented programming).

Benefits of modular design:

- Design the modules and interfaces first, then parallelize development
- Manage complexity
- Code reuse
- Once an interface is created, you can safely forget its implementatio
- Supports refactoring
